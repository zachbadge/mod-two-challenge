Second Module Challenge - Due March 6

# Refactor
This was a refactor of the source code to create a personal portfolio. 
This objective was completed by adding semantic elements to the index.HTML, adding a clear title, including ALT attributes for pictures, and ordering the HTML elements in sequential order.
